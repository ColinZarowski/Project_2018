            We would love to see you in our Fitness Club! We offer many private coaching sessions 
            on Yoga, Zumba, and believe it or not, walking! While our private sessions come with 
            a fee, we do offer free sessions to the public every week. These sessions will encourage 
            proper posture, form, and are extremely insightful. You can take the knowledge from these 
            meetings with you for the rest of your life. If you're unable to join us, we're offering 
            some complimentary information as well.
