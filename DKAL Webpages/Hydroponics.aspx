	<h2>What is Hydroponics?</h2>

	<p>
		Hydroponics has been around for decades. It was originally developed by Nasa around the 
		50's / 60's as a way to feed astronauts on deep space missions and moon missions. 
		Since then, it has been picked up by those wanting to optimize growing techniques. 
		Not the hippies though, they think soil is pure and all that nonsense. 
		Over the past fifteen years, has greatly picked up commercial uses. 
		As a personal endevour - it's still highly associated with weed. 
		Going to the hydroponics section of the garden center, is typically separate from 
		the rest of the building, with heavy doors and bars. There is 
		a large underground culture surrounding it. Which is unfortunate.

	</p>
	<br>
	<p>There are several variations on the theme of Hydroponics, however the overall concept involves a soilless
		growing method that present to the plant, all nutrient required for growth.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>Of the methods, they all have pros and cons, however the method most used commercially is Deep Water Culture (DWC).</p>

	<p>This method uses net pots to hold a growing medium. Typically this can be rockwool or cotton, surrounded by expanded clay. Commercial setups try to reduce labour 
		as much as possible since tens of thousands of plants can be grown in a small area.</p>
	<h2>Advantages / Disadvantages</h2>

	<p>The main advantage to this method is simplicity. Plants are suspended on a floating medium or lid, above the water containing nutrients. Water just touches the bottom of the net pots, 
		allowing the roots to grow into the solution.</p>

	<br />
	<p>
		In order to prevent root rot and issues with anerobic bacteria, the solution must be continously aerated 
		using compressors and air stones. Similar to fish tanks, depending on the scale of the operation.
		Because the plants are presented with ideal water and nutrient levels, the roots grow only to a 
		fraction of what they would in soil. This allows plants to be tightly packed together, which in a soil 
		growing situation, would be impossible.
		As for disadvantages, it mostly has to do with the nutrients. These are petroleum based salts, 
		that as the plant consums them during the growth stages, must be replaced in the water. 
		Even though groing plants with hydroponics can take 10 times less water than in the soil, 
		it still presents large operations with a disposal issue.

	<h2>Where is it currently used?</h2>
	<p>Home growers commercial growers weed research</p>
	<br />
	<h2>Lighting technology advancements</h2>
	<p>Tradiononal grow lights were power hungry beasts that required independent main circuits 
		and exhaust/cooling systems. Typically High-Pressure Sodium or Halogen lights. Today however, 
		continued research has shown most plants only require two spectrums of visible light - red and blue.
		What you end up with is essentially funky pink light. Which from expereince, is super trippy to work around. 
		So typically white lights are added when working in the area. </p>
